# redshift-or-blueshift
A python script which takes the input of interstellar/space images and tells you whether a particular
point on the image is moving towards you or moving away from you by analysing wether its undergoing red shift or blue shift
in doppler effect.
## How to use it
just clone or download this repository and then excute the **color_detection.py** 
where you need to pass the image path as argument from the terminal or comand line.
to execute the command should look like this:
    <blockquote> ~$python color_detection.py -i "path of the image" </blockquote>
example:
    <blockquote> ~$python color_detection.py -i 1.jpg </blockquote>
after executing the script you can just click on the image at different points and see if
it is undergoing red shift or blue shift or is it simply at rest compared to earth.
